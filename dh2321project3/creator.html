        <h1>Design Brief</h1>
        <p>This visualization of Facebook analytic data is intended to be used for everyday users visiting the 'Visualization Studio'. It presents different days' statistics by using a slowly rotating graph depicting the organic reach for each day. The visualization is intended to be used as an ambient information system, and shares the behavior of the taxonomy created by Pousman and Stasko [1]. They define an ambient system as displaying important but non critical data, move from periphery to focus, focus on tangible, subtle changes, and aesthetically pleasing. By slowly rotating the chart and changing the displayed day, the specific day's statistics in a radar chart. The radar value change is slow and show all data without interaction. The visualization is focused on presenting data from a social network, and the goal could be to get insights to what interaction with the page gives the most reach or user interaction. It has the potential to give the user insights that would have been hard to get with a more traditional visualization. The insights as Pousman et.al. talks about in 'Casual Infovis system' [2] are subjective and often reflects the users existing ideas or suspicions. </p>
